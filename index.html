    <h3>Greetings & Salutations</h3>

        <div class="aDayInTheLife">
          <h4>A Day In The Life</h4>
          <p>I am a student whose major interest is Computer Science. As of Fall 2017, it has not been all that stressful, thankfully. This allows me to keep a balance within my education, social, and free time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="meTime">
          <h4>Me Time</h4>
          <p>I believe I am an open minded person so there are times where I find myself trying new things. When I get the chance, I practice the guitar, listen to music, go to concerts, hang with friends, thrift, ride around with my nickle board, and for sure more things that I suddenly cannot think of at the moment. Anyways, those who know me, know that I am with my best friend Chris practically most of the time. However, those who know me a little better though, know that I sleep LITERALLY any chance I get. I also enjoy eating but who doesnt't. ((:</p>

        <div class="musicTaste">
          <h4>My Music Taste</h4>
          <p>I love music and I could talk about my favorite and the different types of music all day. I do not have a favorite band or a favorite song because there are so many to chose from. Except, hands down, Rock is my favorite genre because there is not a type that I do not like from Rock. Lately, I have been listening to The Growlers, Neck Deep, and Movements. Also, I have a record player so I go vinyl shopping from time to time. </p>

          <h4>Bucket List</h4>
          <p> My dad has been a truck driver my whole life, so I have experienced being on the road a lot, which I enjoy. Though I got the chance to road within half of the United States, I would love to travel the world too to discover and learn the different kinds of lifestyles out there that I am not familiar with in hopes that I am able to find the person who I always wanted to be. For that reason this is what my Bucket List consists of.... </p>

      <h2>The End....</h2>
      <p>Overall, I think this page would give you a better idea of what kind of human I am and what my interests are. Since the holidays are right around the corner, I thought it would not have been weird of me to add in a wish list, I mean it had been on my mind lately so why not right. Anyways, this is my little project thank you! (:</p>
